# QR Code Sharing Functionality - Fixed

## 🔧 Issues Identified & Fixed

### **Root Cause**
The main issue was that React Native's built-in `Share` API doesn't support sharing images on Android - it only shares text. This is why:
- ✅ **Saving to gallery worked** (uses MediaLibrary API)
- ❌ **Sharing didn't include images** (React Native Share limitation)

## 🚀 New Sharing Flow

### **1. Primary Method: Advanced Sharing**
- Uses `react-native-share` library when available (development builds)
- Supports image sharing on both iOS and Android
- Handles platform-specific optimizations

### **2. Fallback Method: Save + Manual Share**
- When advanced sharing isn't available (Expo Go)
- Automatically saves QR code to photos
- Provides clear instructions for manual sharing

### **3. Text-Only Sharing**
- Shares pass details as formatted text
- Includes all important information
- Works in all environments

## 📱 User Experience Flow

```
User taps "Share Pass"
        ↓
Is react-native-share available?
        ↓
    YES → Try advanced image sharing
        ↓
    Success? → Show success message
        ↓
    Failed/Cancelled? → Offer alternatives:
        • Save to Photos
        • Share Text Only
        ↓
    NO → Show sharing options:
        • Share Text Only
        • Save & Share Manually
```

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Detects user cancellation vs actual errors
- Provides specific error messages
- Offers alternative actions

### **Platform Optimization**
- **Android**: Optimized file URI format, removed conflicting message+image
- **iOS**: Full image+text sharing support
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent user experience

### **File Management**
- Verifies image exists before sharing
- Proper cleanup with delays
- Handles temporary file errors gracefully
